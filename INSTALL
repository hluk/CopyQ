Steps to build and install
==========================

To build and install the application CMake is required (http://www.cmake.org/).

On Ubuntu you'll need packages libqt4-dev, cmake, libxfixes-dev,
libxtst-dev (optional; auto-paste into some applications),
libqtwebkit-dev (optional; advanced HTML rendering).

Build with following commands:

    cmake .
    make

To install run (sudo is required for root privileges on Linux):

    sudo make install


Building and Packaging for OS X
-------------------------------

To build and install on OS X, you will need `qmake` version
5.2 or greater. Build with the following commands:

    ~/Qt/5.2.0/clang_64/bin/qmake CONFIG+=release WITH_WEBKIT=1
    make copyq.app

This will produce a self-contained application bundle `copyq.app`
which can then be copied or moved into `/Applications`.
