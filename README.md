### Debian 10+, Ubuntu 18.04+, and their derivatives

Install `copyq` package.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:hluk/copyq
sudo apt update
sudo apt install copyq
```

```bash
flatpak install flathub com.github.hluk.copyq
```

Start the application from menu or with following command:

```

## Using the App

To start the application double-click the program icon or run `copyq`.

The list with clipboard history is accessible by clicking on system tray icon
or running `copyq toggle`.

Copying text or image to clipboard will create new item in the list.

Selected items can be:

* edited (`F2`)
* removed (`Delete`)
* sorted (`Ctrl+Shift+S`, `Ctrl+Shift+R`)
* moved around (with mouse or `Ctrl+Up/Down`)
* copied back to clipboard (`Ctrl+C`)
* pasted to previously active window (`Enter`)

All items will be restored when application is started next time.

To exit the application select Exit from tray menu or press `Ctrl-Q` keys in the
application window.

### Adding Functionality

To create custom action that can be executed
from menu, with shortcut or when clipboard changes:
- go to Command dialog (`F6` shortcut),
- click Add button and select predefined command or create new one,
- optionally change the command details (shortcut, name),
- click OK to save the command.

One of very useful predefined commands there is "Show/hide main window".

### Command Line

CopyQ has powerful command line and scripting interface.

Note: The main application must be running to be able to issue commands using
command line.

Print help for some useful command line arguments:

    copyq --help
    copyq --help add

Insert some texts to the history:

    copyq add -- 'first item' 'second item' 'third item'

Omitting double-dash (`--`) in the command above would mean that slash
(`\`) in arguments will be treated as special character so that `\n` is new
line character, `\t` is tab, `\\` is slash, `\x` is `x` etc.

Create single item containing two lines:

    copyq add 'first line\nsecond line'

Print content of the first three items:

    copyq read 0 1 2
    copyq separator "," read 0 1 2

Show current clipboard content:

    copyq clipboard
    copyq clipboard text/html
    copyq clipboard \?    # lists formats in clipboard

Copy text to the clipboard:

    copyq copy "Some Text"

Load file content into clipboard:

    copyq copy - < file.txt
    copyq copy text/html < index.html
    copyq copy image/jpeg - < image.jpg

Create image items:

    copyq write image/gif - < image.gif
    copyq write image/svg - < image.svg
