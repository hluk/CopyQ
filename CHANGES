v3.12.0

- Unsaved data are now saved whenever application is unfocused, otherwise
  immediately after an item is edited and saved or after ~5 minute intervals if
  items change. These intervals can be configured - use `copyq config` to list
  options with `save_delay_` prefix. For example, disable storing after an item
  is added (only when app is unfocused, exits or tab is unloaded):

      copyq config save_delay_ms_on_item_added -1

- Filter field in commands can now modify menu items. This is done by setting
  properties to "menuItem" object. Example:

      copyq:
      menuItem['checkable'] = true
      if (plugins.itempinned.isPinned.apply(this, selectedItems())) {
          menuItem['checked'] = true
          menuItem['text'] = 'Unpin'
          menuItem['color'] = '#f00'
          menuItem['tag'] = 'X'
      } else {
          menuItem['checked'] = false
          menuItem['text'] = 'Pin'
          menuItem['icon'] = ''
      }

- Application icon will no longer automatically change when there is an ongoing
  operation (i.e. the icon snip animation). This caused performance issues in
  some environments and it was not tested automatically so it often broke. When
  clipboard storing is disabled the icon only changes opacity slightly.

v3.9.0

- Large images in clipboard are no longer automatically converted to other
  formats - it caused slowdowns and was mostly unnecessary since some usable
  image format was provided.

- The server/GUI process now provides the clipboard and no other process is
  started (i.e. "copyq provideClipboard"). The other process helped to unblock
  GUI in rare cases when an application requested large amount of clipboard
  data, but it could cause some slowdowns to start the process.

- Closing external editor focuses the edited item again (if the editor was open
  from main window).

- Only Global Shortcut commands are shown in tray menu.

- Separate Global and Application shortcuts into tabs in configuration dialog.

- New per-tab configuration allows disabling storing items on disk and limiting
  number of items.

- New script function unload() and forceUnload() allow unloading tabs from main
  memory.

- Tabs synchronized with a directory on disk are updated only when needed. An
  update happens regularly when synced tab has focus or item data and are too

  COPYQ_SYNC_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MS (in ms).

  change.

  assigned to a global shortcut repeatedly without releasing these keys.

- X11: Fix high CPU usage when mouse selection cannot be accessed.

- X11: Fix assigning global shortcuts with keypad keys

v3.8.0

- Custom settings from scripts (using settings() function) are now saved in
  "copyq-scripts.ini" file in configuration directory. Existing configuration
  needs to be moved manually from "[script]" section in the main configuration
  file ("copyq info config" command prints the path) to "[General]" section to
  the new file (in the same directory).

- Correct clipboard owner (window title) is now used when the window is hidden
  after copy operation (e.g. password manager copies password and hides its
  window immediately).

- New script functions onStart and onExit allow to defined commands run when
  the application starts and exits.

- New script functions pointerPosition and setPointerPosition to get/set mouse
  cursor position on screen.

- New script callback onClipboardUnchanged called when clipboard changes but
  monitored content remains the same.

- Block default shortcut overridden by a command while its filter command needs
  to run.

  activating an item or automatically when unfocused.

  needed.

  sorted - plain text first, HTML, other text, application, application
  specific (`application/x-`), special (uppercase).

- Detect encoding for other text formats.

- Method text for ByteArray returns correctly formatted text from unicode
  encoded data (e.g. UTF-8).

- Show pin and tag menu items even if shortcut is not assigned (can be disabled
  completely in Command dialog).

- Command list is focused when Command dialog opens; the less important "Find"
  field is smaller and moved below the list.

  application start (faster application start, smaller memory footprint).

- Process manager has filter field for searching for commands.

- Process manager has new column showing error message.

- Process manager has color status icons for running, starting and failed
  processes.

- Next/Previous formats are no longer available (were rarely used and
  untested).

- FakeVim, if enabled, is used for other multi-line text fields in the
  application (e.g. item notes, command editor).
- FakeVim, if in a dialog, binds save and quit command to the dialog buttons -
  `:w` for Apply, `:wq` for OK, `:q` for Cancel.
